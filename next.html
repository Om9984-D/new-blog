            <h3 style="text-align: left;"></h3>
            <h5 style="color: #c84b2f;">The Story of the Kumbh Mela</h5>
            <p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-618" style="padding: 10px;" src="https://www.kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Churning-of-the-Milky-Ocean-300x180.jpg" alt="Churning of the Milky Ocean" width="390" height="244">Mythological significance of Kumbh revolves around the story of the samudra manthan or ocean churning which was done by the gods and demons to obtain the invaluable ratnas or the jewels and amrita or the nectar of immortality. The mountain Mandrachala become churning stick and the Nagraja Vasuki acted as the rope. The Lord Vishnu himself took form of Kasava or tortoise and provided base for the mountain Mandrachala with fear that it may get slipped and submerged in the ocean. &nbsp;The story is symbolic of the churning of our minds to go deeper into our selves from where all powers and auspicious things arise, eventually leading to liberation or immortality.</p>
            <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-662" src="https://www.kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shiva-drinking-poison-265x300.jpg" alt="Shiva drinking poison" width="265" height="300" srcset="https://kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shiva-drinking-poison-265x300.jpg 265w, https://kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shiva-drinking-poison-129x146.jpg 129w, https://kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shiva-drinking-poison-44x50.jpg 44w, https://kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shiva-drinking-poison-66x75.jpg 66w, https://kumbhmela.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Shiva-drinking-poison.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px">The first to emerge in this churning was a venomous poison which was consumed by the Lord Shiva who upon drinking this poison came to be called as the Nilkantha. The churning continues and emerged Kamdhenu, the Uccaishrava Jayanta, the son of Lord Indra , catching sight of the amrita kalasa or the pot filled with nectar, snatched it from the the hands of God Dhanvantari. Noticing this, Lord Shukracharya , the Guru of demons alerted and demons chased Jayanta. According to the divine counting one day of Gods is equal to the one year of mortal beings and the Jayanta kept on running for 12 days to avoid amrit kalasha to fall in the hands of demons.</p>
            <p>The four places where Jayanta had put down the amrit kalasha in these twelve years were Haridwar, Prayag, Nashik-Trimbakeshwar and Ujjain, and at these four places at that time the sun, moon ,and planets had reached the unique astrological alignment, during which are kumbhmela is held at these places. The nectar pot was saved from the demons by God Brihaspati with the help of Sun , his son Lord Shani and Moon who saved the nectar kumbh from getting damaged.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in the Skanda purana, kumbhmela is not just celebrated where the amrit kalasa was put down , but where the nectar had spilled along with putting down of the kalasa.&nbsp;It is believed that these drops gave mystical powers to these places.&nbsp;It is to make oneself gain on those powers that Kumbh Mela has been celebrated in each of the four places since long as one can remember.</p>
            <p>The normal Kumbh Mela is held every 3 years, the Ardh (half) Kumbh Mela is held every six years at Haridwar and Allahabad (Prayag) while the Purna (complete) Kumbh mela takes place every twelve years, at four places Prayag (Allahabad), Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik, based on planetary movements. The <a href="https://www.kumbhmela.com/kumbha-parva-chakra/" target="_blank">Maha Kumbh Mela</a> is celebrated at Prayag after 144 years (after 12 ‘Purna Kumbh Melas’).</p>
            <p>Depending on what position the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter hold in that period in different zodiac signs, the venue for Kumbh Mela is decided.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h5 style="color: #c84b2f;">Astrological aspect</h5>
            <p>The Astrological aspect of Kumbh is related with traversing planets and stars and their certain alignment . As per the Vedas the Sun is considered as a soul like or life giving. The moon is considered as a lord of Mind. The planet Jupiter or Brihaspati is consider as Guru of Gods. As it takes almost 12 years for Jupiter to transverse to complete zodiac , so the Kumbh is celebrated in accordance at one place after about every twelve years.</p>

The Kumbh Festival, a human congregation of spirituality is held at Nashik-Trimbakeshwar, Prayag (Allahabad), Haridwar and Ujjain . Ardh Kumbh is held at Prayag and Haridwar after every six years.The Kumbh Fair is held at the banks of sacred rivers every 12 years.</p>
            <p>At Nashik – Trimabkeshwar it is held at the banks of river Godavari. At Prayag it is held at sangam, the confluence of the rivers Ganga-Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati, at the banks of Ganga at Haridawar and at the banks of Kshipra at Ujjain. It is marked by the fact that millions of people participate in this great fair without any summons, call, notice or invitation.</p>
            <p>Nashik is believed to be the part of Dandakaranya, where Lord Rama lived during his exile. Trimbakeshwar is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The sacred river Godavari originates here on Bramhagiri hills. Trimbakeshwar is having Samadhi of shri sant Nivruttinath who is supposed to be founder of Nath Sampradaya.</p>
            <p>This Kumbh is unique as Vaishnav Akhadas and Shaiva Akhadas which bath together at Prayag, Haridwar and Ujjain, baths separately here. As a result of arrangements made by the Peshwas due to clashes between ascetics of both sects , Vaishnva Akhadas baths at Nashik and Shaiva or Sanyasis, Udasin Akhadas baths at Trimbakeshwar.</p>
