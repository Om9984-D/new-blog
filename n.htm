On 4 February 2019, Kumbh Mela witnessed the largest peaceful public gathering of humans ever recorded.[1] It is celebrated in a cycle of approximately 12 years, to celebrate every revolution Brihaspati (Jupiter) completes.[2] Kumbh is mainly held at four riverside pilgrimage sites, namely: Prayagraj (Ganges-Yamuna-Sarasvati rivers confluence), Haridwar (Ganges), Nashik (Godavari), and Ujjain (Shipra);[1][3] But now the Kumbh Mela has been revived at a fifth place too.[4] The other rejuvenated Kumbh Mela is celebrated at Bansberia Tribeni Sangam in West Bengal at the confluence of Hooghly and Saraswati river, dates back thousands of years but was stopped 700 years ago,</p>
